# Spotift_Music_Recommendation_Project

Recently, I worked on a Spotify Music Recommendation system combining the power of Machine Learning, Flask, and Bootstrap – and I’d love to share a glimpse of it.

Backend (ML Logic):
Using Jupyter Notebook, I implemented the recommendation algorithm using cosine similarity and pandas, trained on Spotify dataset features.

Web Interface:
I developed the frontend using Bootstrap and connected it with a Flask backend in VS Code to create a smooth and responsive user experience.

How it works:
Enter your favorite song → The app fetches similar tracks based on audio features → You get smart, Spotify-style recommendations!

This project helped me understand:
✅ Data handling and similarity metrics
✅ Flask routing and integration
✅ Frontend-backend connectivity using HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
✅ Creating a complete ML-powered web app from scratch!
